# CS6890-Project-Code
To run the code from the Hidden Communitites paper to the HiCode directory and follow the readme instructions in that directory

To run the code from the Density Optimization paper, install R and then run the DensityOPT.R script. There is a string in the script that points to the location of the graph text files. Make sure you change that string in the script to the location of the desired graph text file. I used RStudio to run the scripts and had to use an absolute path, but a relative path might work outside of RStudio.
